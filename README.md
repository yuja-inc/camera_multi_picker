## Installation

First, add camera_multi_picker as a dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.

iOS

- The camera_multi_picker plugin compiles for any version of iOS, but its functionality requires iOS 10 or higher. If compiling for iOS 9, make sure to programmatically check the version of iOS running on the device before using any camera_multi_picker plugin features. The device_info_plus plugin, for example, can be used to check the iOS version.
Add two rows to the ios/Runner/Info.plist:

- one with the key Privacy - Camera Usage Description and a usage description.
and one with the key Privacy - Microphone Usage Description and a usage description.
If editing Info.plist as text, add:

- NSCameraUsageDescription your usage description here NSMicrophoneUsageDescription your usage description here

Android

Change the minimum Android sdk version to 21 (or higher) in your android/app/build.gradle file.

minSdkVersion 21

            MultipleImageCamera.capture(context: context).then((value) {
              setState(() {
                images = value ;

                itemBuilder: (context, index) {
                  return Image.file(File(images[index].file.path));
